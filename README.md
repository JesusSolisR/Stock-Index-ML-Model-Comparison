# Project title: ML Model Comparison for Stock Index Performance Classification

## Data Science Institute - Cohort 7 - Team 16 Project Report

For our team project, we selected the "Stock Exchange Data" dataset.

# Business Case


# Problem 


### Project Objective
- Team selected Stock Exchange classification problem to predict stock index price trends based on opening / closing prices.
- Make a recommendation on which model(s) to use for the selected index.
- Best model(s) identified, and we come together to make top recommendations for models to use, including nuances of the problem (e.g., only used open / closed date) and further considerations (e.g., Model A is best for low variance; Model B is best for high variance, etc.)

## Requirements
1. high-level data architecture and model (i.e., how GitHub + analysis is organized, data is cleaned and separated, etc.)
2. Download and cleanse data in GitHub repository
3. Align on standardized fields required across all analysis files (per index)
4. Select indices for each group members' focus
5. Create GitHub branches per group member
6. Clone repositories per group member


# Scope 
## Realisic Scenario:
- Pick one index to identify which ML model can best forecast price trends in consecutive days.
- Using Linear Regression as a base ML model and comparing it to 4 advanced ML models (XGBoost, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN)

## Optimistic Scenario:
- Use all 14 indices for ML model forecasting

# Ownership / Involvement:
- Jesus to lead technical side (setup repository, help with programming challenges, fixing merge issues, etc.)
- Abeer to lead project management (high-level milestones)
- Mark and Mingxia prefers to support with programming and coding (more technical)
